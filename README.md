# Adult Data Prediction Using Naive Bayes Algorithm
In this project, the goal is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year based on various attributes such as age, education level, occupation, and more. This is a binary classification problem, commonly known as the "Census Income" dataset or "Adult" dataset, which is widely used in machine learning.

## Overview of the Naive Bayes Algorithm
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that the features (predictors) are independent of each other, given the class label, even though this assumption might not be entirely accurate in real-world data. Despite this naive assumption, Naive Bayes works well for various classification tasks, including text classification and medical diagnosis.

## Dataset Features
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

Age: Continuous variable representing the individual's age.

Workclass: Categorical variable representing the employment type.

Education: Categorical variable representing the education level.

Marital-status: Categorical variable indicating marital status.

Occupation: Categorical variable indicating the job type.

Race: Categorical variable indicating the individual's race.

Gender: Categorical variable indicating the individual's gender.

Hours-per-week: Continuous variable representing the number of hours worked per week.

Native country: Categorical variable indicating the country of origin.

The target variable is:

Income: Binary variable, where income is either <=50K or >50K.

## Steps to Implement the Naive Bayes Algorithm
1. Data Preprocessing:

* Handling Missing Values: Missing values, if any, need to be handled. Often, they are replaced with the mode for categorical attributes.
  
* Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

* Feature Scaling: Features like age and hours-per-week can be scaled for better performance, though Naive Bayes can handle non-scaled data.

2. Splitting the Data:

Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Building the Naive Bayes Model:

3. Choose the right variant: For this task, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for continuous features, while Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for categorical features.
Train the model using the training data, calculating the probabilities for each class and the conditional probabilities for the features.

4. Prediction and Evaluation:

Use the model to predict whether individuals in the test set earn more than $50,000.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
A confusion matrix can also help in analyzing the model's prediction errors.

5. Improvement and Tuning:

Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.
Hyperparameter tuning can be done, though Naive Bayes typically has fewer hyperparameters to tune compared to other algorithms.
